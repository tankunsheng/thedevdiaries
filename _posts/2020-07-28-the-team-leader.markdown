Every team works best by having a balanced ratio of people who are detail-oriented and broad-based thinkers. The former is commonly associated with engineering work due to the specificities involved in the production of a piece of software or a system. As for the management, a generalist who has a strong understanding of the business domain, its operating context, as well as having a high-level understanding of the technical details will fare pretty well as their role demands a certain degree of versatility in ideas, to be applied over a wider range of topics. 

## Gap between Management and Engineers
Unfortunately, there is often a gap between these two roles that is hard to close. The dev team struggles to communicate the details of their work without overloading the management with information and thus, it is a challenge to convey the state of any project and the trajectory it is on. 

One of many things usually happens here. The management adopts a hands-free approach and lets the dev team drive the implementation of the project. Of course, a requisite must already be present, which is, that the dev team had already instilled a certain level of confidence in the management. Enough for them to be convinced that the team can run on its own for the most part while hitting key milestones with minimal meetings involved. Most of the time, we do not get this, however. When the dev team fails to communicate the statuses clearly, (which is not easy to do in big projects with multiple teams) what happens is usually the knee-jerked reaction of oversubscribing to meetings, updates, and presentations.

## The Importance of a Team Lead
Aside from the many modern software and project development methodologies that vow to improve team dynamics and project success, there is one more factor that is as important, if not more - a leader. By leader, I refer to not someone with a fancy title, it is not authoritative power that I am referring to, but instead, someone on the ground who is well connected to the developers and the engineers. Someone who has vast experience in hands-on work and might perhaps still very much be involved in the development works. Coupled with a dose of good business acumen, and great interpersonal skills, this will be the single most member of the team in bridging the gap between the management, business stakeholders, and the technical team of engineers. Ideally, these are the ideal properties and characteristics of the role of a team leader to me and I think that it is important to be able to:

**1. Understand the team and resources at hand**

Know his/her team's capabilities well and understand what is realistically attainable within the boundaries of the resources at work. This is not as easy as it seems because it requires one to have real hands-on experience in order to gauge the abilities of others reasonably well. Taking into account the many different disciplines of software engineering (App dev, devops, networking, infra), you can see why this is particularly challenging.

**2. Well-versed in the business and tech domains**

Understanding how to deliver business value through the implementation of technological solutions that make the most sense given the context of the team's capabilities. I think going for the "perfect" solution can easily get out of hand. It is best to ground the expectations with reality, the reality of the resources you are given to work with and also, the business's objectives. Sometimes, engineers get way ahead of themselves when it comes to building stuff and instead of a script or a program, we aim to build a genericized feature, tool, platform or framework.

The team lead will need to be able to exercise sound judgment to determine if these efforts are worth it and whether it does make business sense to pursue such endeavors, or perhaps, to adopt simpler approaches that are easier to maintain.

**3. A tinge of charisma goes a long way**

Not to push the stereotype further, but you have to acknowledge that one of the common reasons why most of us chose to be in the software engineering industry is due to not wanting to deal with people. Most of the software peeps you have meet are probably as charismatic as a rock, myself included. Very occasionally, you will be able to find an engineer who is as eloquent and charismatic as they are technically strong. These people are really valuable to the team as long as they are not psychopaths, I kid. Yeah, but really, all teams can really use a team-mate who is charismatic, capable, and empathetic because these are people that truly brings the team together and lift everyone up.

**4. Manage expectations of client and management**

The points above converge into this final important factor. Of being able to manage the expectations of both the management and the client. TLDR, the ideal skills and traits that define an effective team leader in my mind would be able to:

Understand the business domain well enough to identify the key business needs and requirements. 

Understand technology space well enough to know how to translate these business requirements into technical solutions. 

Understand the team and the resources at hand well enough in order to evaluate the feasibility of different solutions and arrive at a project plan which is realistic, practical, and detailed.

Lastly, possess the flair and charisma to advise, convince, and even influence the decision making from the management or clients. There should also be a willingness to speak up for the team, and in the event of unreasonable and impractical directives passed down from the management, have the conviction to push back and raise all concerns for the team.

Now, this is a team lead that I wish to follow.
