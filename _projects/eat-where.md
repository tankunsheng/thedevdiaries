## Background

Picture the usual lunch hour scene. I look at you, you look at someone else, and everyone's unwilling to be the one to suggest the next worse lunch venue. The solution? Outsource this.

This app generates randomized suggestions to eating and drinking establishments around you with an adjustable proximity to limit your area of search. Don't think so much, just randomize and go lah.

<p class="text-accent">Unfortunately, this app is no longer working atm due to changes in Google Places APIs. Will get back to it if there is time to spare.</p>

## 1. Search and View

<div class="container mx-auto px-2 py-4 table">
    <div class="prose col-2 sm-width-half left">
        <img src="https://kunshengsite.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/projects/android/eatware/eatware-search.jpg" alt="ftt_start_test" />
    </div>
    <div class="prose col-2 sm-width-half left ml-lg-4">
        <img src="https://kunshengsite.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/projects/android/eatware/eatware-details.jpg" alt="ftt_test" />
    </div>
    <div class="prose col-2 sm-width-half left ml-lg-4">
        <img src="https://kunshengsite.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/projects/android/eatware/eatware-gallery.jpg" alt="ftt_test_results" />
    </div>
</div>

Eat Where queries for restaurants and bars from Google Places API based on your current location. You can toggle your search surface to have a larger or smaller set of results. 

## 2. Reviews

<div class="container mx-auto px-2 py-4 table">
    <div class="prose col-2 sm-width-half left">
        <img src="https://kunshengsite.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/projects/android/eatware/eatware-reviewlist.jpg" alt="ftt_start_test" />
    </div>
    <div class="prose col-2 sm-width-half left ml-lg-4">
        <img src="https://kunshengsite.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/projects/android/eatware/eatware-review.jpg" alt="ftt_test" />
    </div>
</div>
Then, check out the  reviews of these establishments from their respective Google+ pages, if they have one (is Google+ a thing?)

Eat Where was a simple app that was meant to be for laughs really. I think I spent more time trying to create graphical assets on InkScape more than actually writing code.
